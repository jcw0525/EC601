Product Mission Statement:
A common refrain for those seeking to learn a new language is that immersion offers the most effective method for acquisition; while this is certainly true, most people do not have the opportunity to temporarily move to a foreign country. Rather, most of us must content ourselves with traditional classroom-based approaches to language learning. However, this app offers an avenue for simulating immersion in a classroom setting. With the application of Google Streetview, students can be dropped anywhere in the world, where a teacher can provide a set of navigational directions as though they were a passerby on the street. As such students can practice translation and navigation to approach some destination as practice and application of their burgeoning language skills. To offer yet another tool in the arsenal of teachers to communicate and develop language acquisition is the mission statement of this product more effectively.

Language Teachers:
A teacher wishes to offer an interactive exercise for their students learning a foreign language. They boot up this application, and by toggling map visibility, they are able to select anywhere in the world to begin an exercise. For example, a French teacher may select a random street in Paris. They will then begin, in accordance with their students' proficiency, to write directions while using Google Streetview to move through the city. Perhaps they write, "go north until the pub," "turn towards the river," "cross the bridge and turn left," etc. until they reach their final destination, say the Eiffel Tower. The teacher then saves the exercise and sends the output text to their students.

Language Learners:
Upon receiving a set of instructions, they paste the text into the application and load the exercise. They then receive one direction at a time and make their way towards the destination. Upon reaching each checkpoint, they are awarded a score based on their time, and upon reaching the end, every student achieves a final score. Further development beyond the MVP will hopefully allow for implementation of groups of exercises, so that students may more completely explore their language environment. Additionally, they can simply use Google Streetview to virtually explore a foreign country immersed in the language of interest.
